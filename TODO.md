- [ ] Multiple windows and parallel testing?
- [ ] Better specs
- [x] Fix travis which seems to be tedious (needs xvfb)
- [ ] Move from electron to [zombiejs](https://github.com/assaf/zombie)?? Looks like its faster, but it does not seem so active
- [ ] Catch errors in electron thrown by evaluate script and return them to crystal
- [ ] Use spawn instead of fork?
- [ ] Find a way to avoid passing the logger as a constant
- [ ] Think about: Does docker make sense for this project?
