# stoertebeker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ragmaanir/stoertebeker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ragmaanir/stoertebeker)[![Dependency Status](https://shards.rocks/badge/github/ragmaanir/stoertebeker/status.svg)](https://shards.rocks/github/ragmaanir/stoertebeker)

Headless (pun about [StÃ¶rtebeker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_St%C3%B6rtebeker)) integration testing of crystal web-applications.

### Version 0.2.0
This is very alpha. PRs and help welcome!

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stoertebeker:
    github: ragmaanir/stoertebeker
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "stoertebeker"
```

### Example
Currently you need to instantiate a context (might change soon, was experimenting a bit). The context creates the electron server (headless browser based on electron, server written in typescript) and the crystal client which communicate via IPC. The server accepts a series of commands which are sent by the client (like request-a-url or take-a-screenshot).

```crystal
# create the context
context = Stoertebeker::Context.new

# run starts the electron-server, and the crystal client for electron
Stoertebeker.run(context) do
  context.run do |c|
    c.request("localhost:3001/example.html")
    c.wait_for("h1")
    # c.screenshot("./test.png")
  end
end
```

I recommend a separate test setup for integration tests (so it is easy to do different setups for these kind of specs, like resetting the DB, clearing caches etc).


#### Using Microtest

```crystal
# spec_helper.cr
require "microtest"
require "http/server"

require "../src/stoertebeker"
require "../src/stoertebeker/test_adapters/microtest"

include Microtest::DSL

LOGGER = Logger.new(STDOUT)
# LOGGER.level = Logger::DEBUG

Stoertebeker.run_microtest(LOGGER) do
  HTTP::Server.new("localhost", 3001, [
    HTTP::ErrorHandler.new,
    HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new("./spec/public", directory_listing: false),
  ])
end

```

```crystal
# example_spec.cr
require "./spec_helper"

describe Stoertebeker do
  FILE_PATH = File.expand_path("./temp/test.png")

  test "readme example" do
    request("http://localhost:3001/example.html")
    wait_for("h1")
    screenshot(FILE_PATH)

    assert File.exists?(FILE_PATH)
    assert File.size(FILE_PATH) > 0
    File.delete(FILE_PATH)
    assert current_url == "http://localhost:3001/example.html"
  end
end

```

Minitest and the regular crystal spec setup should be similar:

```crystal
# Minitest test_helper.cr
require "minitest"
require "http/server"

require "../src/stoertebeker"
require "../src/stoertebeker/test_adapters/minitest"

LOGGER = Logger.new(STDOUT)

Stoertebeker.run_minitest(LOGGER) do
  HTTP::Server.new("localhost", 3001, [
    HTTP::ErrorHandler.new,
    HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new("./spec/public", directory_listing: false),
  ])
end

```

## TODO


- [ ] Multiple windows and parallel testing?
- [ ] Better specs
- [ ] Fix travis which seems to be tedious
- [ ] Move from electron to [zombiejs](https://github.com/assaf/zombie)?? Looks like its faster, but it does not seem so active
- [ ] Catch errors in electron thrown by evaluate script and return them to crystal
- [ ] Use spawn instead of fork?
- [ ] Find a way to avoid passing the logger as a constant


## Development

Some internals:

- The electron server is in `/browser` and uses IPC to accept a few commands
- The crystal client provides methods to send these commands an wait for the response (synchronous)
- Starting and stopping server and client is annoying and not exactly deterministic. I am no expert in that. But so far it works.
- Only one window is used currently and the electron instance can only deal with one test at a time. But ideally it should probably be able to run several tests in parallel. Maybe this could be done with multiple electron server instances instead of complicating the test setup.
- The `README.md` is generated from `README.md.template` by running `./build`. There is a pre-commit hook `hooks/pre-commit` that you can set up by symlinking it to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
